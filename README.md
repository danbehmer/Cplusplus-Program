# Cplusplus-Program
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project's main purpose was to help a grocery store update their inventory system. To help them keep track, we produced a list of all items purchased within the day along with the number of times each item was purchased. It also produced a number prepresenting how many times a certain item was purchased within a given day. And finally it produced a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representatiuon of the number of times each item was pruchased.

# What did you do particularly well?
  What I fell as though I did well was explain what my program was trying to do, by utilizing comments throughout the program.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  To enhance my code, I would start with not over explaining my code. While having comments is necessary, over explaining within those comments, or having too many comments in general will start to make the program feel cluttered, and will also slow down the entire programming process.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging portion of the code was the inventory system. I had to figure out a way to keep track of what was being sold, and how many of those items were being sold. To overcome this, I had spoken with a friend to see if he had any ideas, and he suggested that I find a way to create a dictionary, and any times that the item was found within that dictionary, to increment that item being sold.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  The skills learned and applied from this project that will be transferable to other projects would be how I structure my code and how I include comments within my code to keep the user up to speed on what is happneing.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Using in-line comments and correct indentation is what helped make this program readable, maintainable, and adaptable.
